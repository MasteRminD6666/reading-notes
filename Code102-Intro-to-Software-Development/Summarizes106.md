# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

-----

**CSS:** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
**CSS** describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
**CSS** is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. 
Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, 
which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.

**CSS first steps**
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns,
or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works,
what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.

**CSS layout**
At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. 
Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now 
dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
