## Cloud Storage vs. Local Storage: Main differences


Ensuring that company data is safe and secure is important for any business. Thus, deciding whether to store that data on the cloud or on-site is a big decision for businesses to make. There are advantages and disadvantages to both options. Learning what they are can help you make the best choice for your business. The most obvious differences are how and where the data is stored. 

What is local storage? Local storage usually refers to anything that is ‚Äúon-premise‚Äù (or ‚Äúon-prem‚Äù, as we say in the biz üòâ) such as a hard drive, flash drive, local file server, or Network Attached Storage drive (NAS drive). Cloud storage, as I stated in an earlier blog What is the Cloud? Plus: Cloud Pros and Cons, is "when you access files and programs over an internet connection instead of on your computer‚Äôs hard drive. In slightly more technical terms, it‚Äôs when you access any information stored in a datacenter via the internet."

Advantages of Local Storage
Speed: With local storage, you are not limited by your internet bandwidth. More often than not, your transfer speeds will be drastically faster with local storage compared to cloud storage. For instance, The theoretical transfer speed of USB 3.0 is 4.8 Gbit/s (600MBps). More realistically, you‚Äôll see sustained speeds of around 85-100MBps. This is still significantly faster than download speeds provided by most ISPs.

Cost per GB: While this is becoming less of a factor as cloud storage become cheaper and more available, as of the time of this writing, the cost of storage on local devices is quite a bit cheaper when compared to cloud storage. Now when I say this, I‚Äôm talking about small scale local storage. (think hard drives and flash drives) When talking about large scale, full server solutions, this is not the case. I will go into this later in this blog.

Availability: With local storage, you do not need an outside internet connection to access your data. Therefore, you are not at the mercy of your ISP‚Äôs uptime and connectivity to access your data.



## Advantages of Cloud Storage
Ease of accessibility: With cloud storage, you can access your data from anywhere as long as you have a connection to the internet. Got a request for an impromptu meeting while you‚Äôre away from the office? No problem! You can access your files in OneDrive and have everything you need.

## No risk of data loss:
I get this question a lot: "Is cloud storage safer than local storage?" With cloud storage, your data has multiple backups within your storage provider‚Äôs data centers. There‚Äôs no need to fear a catastrophic loss due to hardware failing or being misplaced. Short answer: Yes.

## Overall price:
With cloud storage, you have ZERO hardware to purchase and maintain. You also don‚Äôt have to pay for cooling systems to ensure your servers are running efficiently, you don‚Äôt have to pay for electricity to run the servers 24/7, and you don‚Äôt have to pay someone‚Äôs salary to maintain the hardware. You just pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee to use cloud storage, and that‚Äôs it. This makes it much easier to budget out in the long run.

# What is HTML5 storage?

HTML5 local storage is a component of the Web storage application programming interface. It is a method by which Web pages locally store named key/value pairs inside a client's Web browser. Similar to cookies, this saved data exists - even when you close a browser tab, surf away from a current website, exit a browser tab or close a main browser. Unlike cookies, this data is not carried to the remote Web server unless it is sent manually. Because HTML5 local storage is natively integrated into Web browsers, it is available without third-party browser plug-ins. It is described in the HTML5 specifications.
