GUI : Graphical User Interface (The normal windows screens)

CLI : Command Line Interface (The black screen terminal)

---
We talked about Terminal Commands :

Terminal commands :
ls : will list for me directories(folders) and files (That are not hidden)
ls -la : List all files (with hidden ones)
cd (Change Directory) : to open a certain directory(folder), example: cd test -> here I want to open a directory called test
cd ..  : to go back from my current directory(folder) to the previous one -> if I'm in test directory and want to go back to the previous one (let's assume it's called testPrevious) then I just type cd ..
mkdir :(Make directory) to create a directory(folder) -> mkdir newTest , here I now have a new directory called newTest
Directory is a Folder and this folder will have the Files of my project, so if I want to create a file I use:
touch command, and don't forget the extension of the file, example touch index.html will create an HTML file
pwd (Print Working Directory) : to see where I am now
clear : clears the terminal

And Also we Used git Commands to Add push commit **ACP** and pull clone



Git : version control system, it's on our local machine, we can see our files, what changes are made, why they are made and by who, the most popular commands using Git are add-commit-push which developers refer to them as ACP
These are some of git commands that you will use the most :
git clone (the link of my repo) : to have my repo downloaded on my local machine, I do this one time
ACP: add-commit-push commands I do them regularly
git add . (with space) : when I do some changes on my file I use git add . or instead of . I can add the file name itself, but we use . as a shortcut to stage the changes in all files and folders in my repo
git commit -m 'the message you want' (the msg should be between ' ' or " ") : to commit my changes
git push origin main : in order to have my changes on GitHub (on the cloud) I use git push origin main,
You will be asked to provide your username and password of your GitHub account (when writing the password you will not see anything)
When I go back to GitHub, I refresh the page and I will see my changes that I added on my files and I can also see my commit messages
git status: will give us an explanation about what's happening, the state of our repo, we can see the changes that we did and to see the tracked and untracked files
