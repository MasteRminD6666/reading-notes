Input: Your keyboard and mouse, for example, are just input units—ways of getting information into your computer that it can process.
If you use a microphone and voice recognition software, that's another form of input.
**Memory/storage:** Your computer probably stores all your documents and files on a hard drive: a huge magnetic memory. 
But smaller, computer-based devices like digital cameras and cellphones use other kinds of storage such as flash memory cards.
**Processing:** Your computer's processor (sometimes known as the central processing unit) is a microchip buried deep inside. It works amazingly hard and gets incredibly
hot in the process. That's why your computer has a little fan blowing away—to stop its brain from overheating!
**Output:** Your computer probably has an LCD screen capable of displaying high-resolution (very detailed) graphics, and probably also stereo loudspeakers. You may have an inkjet printer on your desk too to make a more permanent form of output.
