Hey All my name is rami I'm 24 years old 
I'm a graduated student 2021 as computer science 
Why  I joined this course to evaluate my inherent abilities
Although I have accumulated a strong foundational knowledge in this domain, 
I think the best way to move forward would be to get practical working experience in an established platform and of course meeting a new programmers :pray:
