Hello, All my name is **Rami** I'm **24** years old 
I'm a graduated student 2021 as **Computer Science** 
I joined this course to evaluate my inherent abilities,
Although I have accumulated a strong foundational knowledge in this domain, 
I think the best way to move forward would be to get practical working experience in an established platform and of course meeting a new programmers
this course is going to help me alot.
