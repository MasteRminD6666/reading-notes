Images play an important role in any webpage. Though it is not recommended to include a lot of images, but it is still important to use good images wherever required. CSS plays a good role to control image display. You can set the following image properties using CSS.

- The border property is used to set the width of an image border.
- The height property is used to set the height of an image.
- The width property is used to set the width of an image.
- The -moz-opacity property is used to set the opacity of an image.

**The Image Border Property**

- The border property of an image is used to set the width of an image border. This property can have a value in length or in %.
- width of zero pixels means no border.
- border-width: thin;
- border-width: medium;
- border-width: thick;

# What is On-Page SEO?

Think of the most basic search engine optimization tactics:

- Using keywords in your page title and page copy

- Optimizing the meta description to stand out in search engine results pages (SERPs)

- Using HTML code and alt tags

It’s all the measures taken directly within your website to improve its position in search rankings by making it easy for search engine bots to interpret the page as well as give end-users a preview of what they’re clicking through from the SERP. It also takes into consideration overall content quality, page performance, and content structure.

# What is Off-Page SEO?

While on-page SEO refers to the factors you can control on your own website, off-page SEO refers to the page ranking factors that occur off your website, such as backlinks from another site. It also includes your promotion methods, taking into account the amount of exposure something gets on social media
