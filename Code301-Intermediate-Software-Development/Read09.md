## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a program's execution. It must only depend on its input arguments.

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

much easier to read and reason about

data cannot change its structure or the data in it. It's setting a value on a variable that cannot change

## What is Referential transparency?

the fact that an expression, in a program, may be replaced by its value (or anything having the same value)

a software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines. ... Modules make a programmer's job easy

## What does the word ‘require’ do?

 is intended to add separate pieces of code (“modules”) to the current scope, a feature
