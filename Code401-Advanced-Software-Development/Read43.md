## Solving Problems  

Solving programming problems is very useful for enhancing the skills of software developer and chances in getting a job through an interview. In this paragraph are some tips on how to approach such problems or challenges.  

### Common mistakes

A common mistake is the improper allocation of time. Allot of developers starts coding after the first read or even half read. To understand the problem well enough is very important and can reduce the time needed to solve a problem.  

Another mistake is complicated code. Always try to simplify your code and don't get fancy.  

### Steps Of Solving A Problem  

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.  

### 1. Read the problem completely twice

It's important to understand the problem to the level of being able to explain it to another person. Not understanding the problem clearly means not solving it right.  

### 2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.  

This can vary and be more than 3 steps, but it means to divide the steps for solving into mini steps.  

### 3. Optimize the manual steps.  

Here, the previous steps are reconsidered in another way. As if there is another way the problem can be solved easier, or if there are some steps than can be cut or simplified.  

### 4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.  

This step can be skipped if the developer got the picture already. However, in this step the previous steps are imported to the code editor as comments or pseudo-code, and ready to be translated into real code.  

### 5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

This is a strait forward coding. If the problem was not solved at after this step, then either is true:  
  - You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
  - You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

### 6. Optimize the real code.  

In this step the code should be rearranged to be readable as mush as possible. Also, if it can be reduced and all variables have meaningful names.

## Act like you make $1000/hr  

Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive.  

Most people spent their time on meaningless activities and give the image, that their time is cheap. And so others will see it as cheap.  

“Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness. Successful people are not busy, they manage their time efficiently. They value their time and their time is expensive and so people around then respect their time. 

If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.

Focusing on what is important is vital for achieving goals. One has not to waste time and not saying **yes** to everything and everyone.  

Say **yes** to what most matters, and even if there are a 100 good choices, say yes only to few, the most important to achieve your goal.  

“busyness” is nothing more than distraction and procrastination from what really matters.  

As you think about your self, you became what you think. Your thought become your reality. So teach your self and other around you what you ant to be, and in case of time teach them how expensive your time is.  

Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

## How to think like a programmer  

To think like a programmer is to know how to solve problems. Thus, the problem-solving skill is very important and most employers look for it when recruiting.  

This paragraph is dedicated to explain a framework on how to solve problems.  

### Have a framework  

> “The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul   

there are steps to follow for solving a problems, those steps are :

1. Understand  
  Most problems are hard because they are vague. Once they are clear, then it is easy or doable to solve them.

    If you can explain a problem to another person, then you got it!  

1. Plan  
  Before starting to solve a problem. take some time to figure out how to solve and get a clear picture.  

    > “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

1. Divide  
  Don't solve big problem right a head. divide the big problem into small problem that you can solve independently. Then solve them and after that connect them to get the solution for the big problem.  

    > “If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.’  

1. Stuck?  
  If you are stuck, then there are 3 things to do:  
    1. Debug: which is going step by step and seeing how you solved the problem and if there anything wrong or can be changed.  
    1. Reassess: Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach? Or, start anew.  
    1. Research: Sometime the lack of knowledge is the reason, and for that search for it on **Google** for example. Also, you can search for solutions, but be aware to search for solutions on big problems. Try small problems, even if your solution  is right, sometimes another method of solving can open your eyes on a new knowledge or way of solving.  
  
### Practice  

You can only get better by consistent practicing. what you should do is find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy). 

## The 5 Whys  

**The 5 Whys** technique is used on simple or moderate complex problems, to fin the root cause of a problems, and do a counter- measures to solve them.  

This technique is robust and guarantee the problem not coming back.  

There 7 steps to apply **The 5 Whys** technique:  

### 1- Assemble a Team  

Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.  

### 2- Define the Problem  

Observe and discuss the problem to get a clear picture on what is exactly the problem.  

### 3- Ask the First "Why?"  

The answers should be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.  

record the answers as succinct phrases, rather than as single words or lengthy statements.

### 4- Ask "Why?" Four More Times  

For each answer ask 4 "Whys" or around that number untel you reach the root cause of the problem.  

### 5- Know When to Stop  

You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.  

### 6- Address the Root Cause(s)  

Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.  

### 7- Monitor Your Measures  

Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
