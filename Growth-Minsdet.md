Summarize Growth Mindset From My Perspective
===============
---
Everyone faces problems as a part of his life, For me I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. And for me, if i got stuck at some point i ask people around me  i dont just keep that in my head you never know you may did not  get the fire sparkle by yourself untill someone came and says a little tiny idea that you did not think about and it will lead you to solve that problem.

A Growth Mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort
intelligence and talent are simply good starting points,A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
Also allows people to value what they’re doing regardless of the outcome. They’re tackling problems, charting new courses, working on important issues. Maybe they haven’t found the cure for cancer, but the search was deeply meaningful.


As **Sherman Finesilver** says i'm inspired by his quote  he said Don’t worry about failure. Worry about the chances you miss when you don’t even try.
and The very best thing you can do for the whole world is to make the most of yourself.

### My ways to keep myslef in a GrothMindset
* View challenges as opportunities
* Replacing the word "failing" with the word "learning."
* Learn from other people’s mistakes, It’s not always wise to compare yourself to others, but it is important to realise that humans share the same weaknesses.
